liboi is a C library for doing evented I/O. It is intended for building
efficent internet programs.

= Feature Summary
 
 * The library has a minimalist design
   - Does not make internal allocations 
   - Does not wrap functionality of GnuTLS or libev. The user must use those
     libraries in conjuction with liboi. 
 * Supports both server and client sockets.
 * Supports evented file I/O emulation through a thread pool.
 * SSL support 
 * Sendfile (file to socket) with emulation on platforms that do not support
   it.
