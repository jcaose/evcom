liboi is a C library for doing evented I/O. 

This library builds on top of the libev library. It provides a simple
object-oriented abstraction of socket and file I/O.  The special problem of
transport layer security (or SSL) is handled in cooperation with GnuTLS.  

= Feature Summary
 
 * The library has a minimalist design
   - Does not make any internal allocations 
   - Does not wrap functionality of GnuTLS or libev. The user must
     use those libraries in cooperation with liboi. 
 * Supports both server and client sockets.
 * Supports evented file I/O emulation through a thread pool.
 * SSL support.

= Usage

The library is new and under development. Please look at the header files for
current information-it should be mostly self-explanatory. 
The test directory has several example problems.
